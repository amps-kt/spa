# TODOs

- make it clear that each row is clickable/selectable
- stick this whole thing in a modal somehow (and make it not suck)
- fix the filtering to be on instance displayName rather than tags
- not render the tags at all
- fix the supervisor display a little bit
- conditionally render the columns based on user roles (supervisors don't see the supervisor columns)
- create the rest of the procedures for the other 2 project-form pages
