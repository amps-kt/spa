# lvl 4 Project

## Overview

As part of my fourth year individual project at UofG, I'm building a web app for preference based matching. The web app centralises all the administrative functionality in a single location as well as hosts a platform for supervisors to uplaod their projects and students to submit preference lists over those projects. 

## Tech Stack

The project is split into 2 repositories:
- `allocation-app`
